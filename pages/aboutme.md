I am a PhD candidate at the school of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine suprvised by profs. Alex Nicolau and Alex Veidenbaum. My research at UCI is in the realm of compilers, computer vision and high performance computing. 

I have been fortunate to receive a great deal of support and mentorship from Dr. Moh Haghighat, senior principal engineer at Intel Corporation.
