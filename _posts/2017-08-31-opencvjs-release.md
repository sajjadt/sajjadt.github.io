## OpenCV.js

OpenCV.js brings years of OpenCV development in computer vision processing to the web with high efficiency. It provides a collection of carefully selected computer vision functions ranging from image processing, object detection, video analysis, features extraction, deep neural networks, etc. Thanks to JavaScript portability, for the first time, a large collection of vision functions can be used not only on web browsers but also on embedded devices (e.g. IOTs using Node.js) and Desktop application development (e.g. Electron framework). Combined with recent web additions, it helps in realizing novel web applications and experiences such as emerging virtual and augmented reality more efficiently.

In addition, we have developed expansive online resources to help developers and researchers learn more about OpenCV.js and computer vision in general that can be accessed at:

1. [OpenCV.js documentation and tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org)
2. [OpenCV.js demos](https://codepen.io/collection/nJbkNo/)

OpenCV.js can also be used in Node.js based environments. It is published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencv.js).
